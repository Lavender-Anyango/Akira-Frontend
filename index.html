    <h2>My First Week experience at Akirachix</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">
            Applying to Akirachix is one of the best decisions I have ever made.
            <br>
            After four exciting days at AkiraChix, I've been able to immerse myself  
            <br>
            in the dynamic learning environment, thanks to the supportive staff and alumni who 
            <br> 
            helped me catch up on the curriculum.The program is challenging but rewarding, and the  
            <br>
            sense of community is strong. The food, cleanliness, and professionalism are top-notch, 
            <br> 
            creating an ideal environment for learning. If you're considering joining the codeHive program, 
            <br> 
            trust me, it's a step towards a fulfilling career in tech.
